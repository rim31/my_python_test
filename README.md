resolution of 2nd degree equation


bonus : 
- color
- resolution 's steps explain
- resolution 3 degree equation :Tschirnhaus' method
            find X1, then factorise (x-X1)(aX^+bX+c) by changing variable
            then, solve the 2nd degree equation


## Run : resolution of equation
only write equation : ".. * X^0 + .. * X^1 + ..* X^2  + ..  = .. * X^0 + .. * X^1 + ..* X^2  + .."
do not forget any X^n, and write them in increasing order.

```ruby
python computor.py "1 * X^0 + 2 * X^1 + 3 * X^2 = 0"
```
or

```ruby
python computor.py
-1 * X^0 -0.42 * X^1 + 3 * X^2 + 2 * X^3 = -5 *X^0 + 3 * X^1
```
